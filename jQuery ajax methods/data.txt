AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) allows exchanging data with a server and updating parts of a web page without reloading the whole page. 
The jQuery ajax() method provides core AJAX functionality, sending asynchronous HTTP requests to the server. 
All jQuery AJAX methods use the ajax() method, and AJAX requests are triggered by JavaScript code.
